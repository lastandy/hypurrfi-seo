# Last AI

**GPU-Backed Compute Network for Financial AI Applications**

Last AI is a compute network powered by vault deposits that fund GPU acquisition and licensing. Revenue from compute sales flows back to vault participants, creating a self-sustaining flywheel where financial AI applications drive growth across the entire ecosystem.

## Overview

Last AI creates a vertically integrated ecosystem connecting capital, compute infrastructure, and financial applications. Starting with deep Hyperliquid integration through HypurrFi, the network expands to power a comprehensive suite of financial AI agents and tools.

## How It Works

### The Compute-to-Yield Flywheel

```
Vault Deposits → GPU Purchase/Licensing → Compute Sales → Vault Yield → More Deposits
                                ↓
                    Financial AI Applications → Revenue → Token Holders
```

### Capital Flow

1. **Vault Participation**: Users deposit funds into HypurrFi vaults
2. **GPU Acquisition**: Vault funds purchase and license GPU compute infrastructure
3. **Compute Marketplace**: GPUs are sold as compute services to developers and applications
4. **Revenue Distribution**: Compute sales revenue flows back as yield to vault participants
5. **Points System**: Vault participation earns points that convert to LAST tokens at TGE

### Token Economics

**Pre-TGE (Points Era)**
- Vault deposits earn points based on contribution and duration
- Points convert to LAST tokens at Token Generation Event

**Post-TGE (Token Era)**
- LAST token holders stake to earn compute revenue share
- Staked LAST unlocks discounted compute access
- Network contributors receive additional compute discounts
- HYFI token holders receive yield from financial applications built on the network

## Core Products

### HypurrFi Vault
The foundation of the Last AI ecosystem:
- Deposit capital to fund GPU acquisition
- Earn yield from compute sales
- Accumulate points toward LAST token allocation
- Participate in financial application revenue

### Last AI Compute Network
GPU infrastructure optimized for financial AI:
- High-performance compute for trading algorithms
- AI model training and inference
- Real-time market data processing
- Discounted rates for network contributors

### Financial AI Applications
Applications built on Last AI compute generate additional revenue:
- Hyperliquid trading bots and market makers
- Cross-protocol arbitrage agents
- Predictive analytics and signal generation
- Automated portfolio management

**Revenue Sharing**: Applications pay out yield to both HYFI and LAST token holders, creating dual revenue streams.

## Revenue Model

### Primary Revenue: Compute Sales
- External developers pay for GPU compute
- Financial applications consume compute resources
- Enterprise AI workload hosting
- Model training and deployment services

### Secondary Revenue: Application Fees
- Trading bot subscription fees
- Agent-generated trading profits
- Data analytics services
- API access and integration fees

### Distribution
- Vault participants receive compute revenue as yield
- LAST stakers earn ongoing compute revenue share
- HYFI holders receive application revenue share
- Contributors earn discounted compute access
